Sprint 2: 

Sprint Goal: 
The goal of this sprint is to develop fully fleshed out react pages for the user profile, the college team profile, 
and the home-logged-in page; the accompanying backend code necessary for these pages to function will also be completed. 
We are also aiming to have completed our web scraping, and have the data stored in our database, ready and accessible.
